          The difference between short-form and long-form videos is simple:
          short-form videos are short, and long-form videos are long. To be more
          specific, short-form videos are typically under 10 minutes long, while
          long-form videos exceed that 10-minute mark. Youâ€™ll see a lot of
          short-form videos on social media. Target, for example, uses this
          video format on Instagram to advertise its products.

          Youll typically see longer videos on a businesss website or YouTube.
          Video and podcast hosting provider, Wistia, uses long-form video to
          educate its audience about the cost of video production.
